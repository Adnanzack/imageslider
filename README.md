# imageslider

This project is a simple JavaScript-based image slider. It selects images with the class 'slide' and positions them horizontally based on their index. Functions allow users to navigate between slides using previous and next buttons. The slider updates the slide position dynamically, creating a basic slideshow effect with smooth transitions.
